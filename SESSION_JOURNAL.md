## Session 1 — Crash Recovery & Feature Gap Fixes

**Focus:** `renderGames()`, `setupDescribeDish()`, `setupMapControls()` were called in `init()` but never defined, causing the entire app to crash on load.

### What Was Done

#### Problem 1: `renderGames()` missing → whole app broken
`renderGames()` was called in `renderAll()` and `setupTabs()` but never defined. `ReferenceError` during `selectIngredient('miso')` in `init()`, halting JS entirely.

- Added `renderGames()` — Flavour Compass radar chart (Canvas) + initialises Guess-the-Neighbour game
- Added `newGuessGame()` — picks a random ingredient, shows 4 options (1 correct + 3 decoys), tracking score

#### Problem 2: `setupDescribeDish()` missing
Called in `init()` but never defined. The Describe a Dish UI was decorative only.

- Added `describeDish()` — parses natural language ("creamy garlic pasta with mushrooms") into ingredient tags with multi-word phrase matching + fuzzy fallback
- Added `setupDescribeDish()` — wires Enter key + auto-trigger debounce on input

#### Problem 3: `setupMapControls()` missing
Called in `init()` but never defined. The projection method dropdown (`#projMethod`) was decorative.

- Added `setupMapControls()` — wires the selector to re-render the map on change

#### Problem 4: GLP-1 Diet Mode filter reset bug
Hardcoded `class="active"` on first button in `renderChefToolkit()` — toggle lost on re-render.

- Changed to read current state from `dataset.mode` / `dataset.filter` before re-rendering

#### Problem 5: Duplicate `id="arithDropdown"`
Static HTML `arithDropdown` overwritten at runtime by JS template literal → duplicate ID warning.

- Removed the static copy

#### Accessibility
- Added `aria-label` to all 21 `<input>` elements
- Added `for` attributes to `<label>` elements for Compare2 inputs

#### Testing
- 26/26 automated Playwright tests pass across all 13 tabs, model switching, search, Analyzer, Compare2, Arithmetic, Seasonal, SLERP, Games
- GLP-1 filter toggle verified (off → on → off persists)
- Substitution mode switching (current/cooc/chem) verified
- Describe a Dish ("creamy garlic pasta with mushrooms") verified: 4 ingredients matched, tags clickable, Explore + Analyze buttons functional

## Session 9 — Deep Analysis & 10-Feature Implementation Sprint

**Focus:** Responding to a comprehensive strategic review with 10 concrete improvements spanning PWA, UX, accessibility, performance, and new features.

### What Was Done

#### Tier 1 — Quick Wins (4 items, ~1 hr)

| # | Feature | Detail |
|---|---------|--------|
| 1 | **📱 PWA Manifest + Home Screen Icon** | Inline `data:application/json` manifest + `theme-color` + `apple-mobile-web-app-capable` meta tags. "Add to Home Screen" works on mobile. |
| 2 | **🌙 Dark Mode Toggle** | `.light` CSS class swapping all 15 color variables. `toggleTheme()` with `localStorage('epicure_theme')` persistence. Button in header. |
| 3 | **🔑 Spoonacular Graceful Degradation** | `renderSpoonacular()` hides feature panels when no API key, shows friendly onboarding banner with feature list and link to spoonacular.com. |
| 4 | **✋ Map Gesture Hint** | First-visit overlay on touch devices: "Drag to pan · Pinch to zoom · Double-tap to reset". Fades after 4s, fires once per user via `localStorage('epicure_map_hint_done')`. |

#### Tier 2 — Medium Impact (4 items, ~5 hrs)

| # | Feature | Detail |
|---|---------|--------|
| 5 | **🔬 Cross-Model Consensus** | New `crossModelConsensus()` computes similarity across all 3 loaded models. Substitutions show color-coded agreement glyphs (◆ ◈ ◇ in green/yellow/red). 💡 panel shows full per-model breakdown. |
| 6 | **🔍 Unified Smart Search Bar** | Merged search + describe-a-dish into one input. Auto-detects: single-word → ingredient autocomplete; multi-word with spaces → describe-dish parsing (350ms debounce). Hidden `#describeInput` preserved for backward compat. |
| 7 | **🧬 Molecular Fingerprint Card** | Enhanced Chef's Toolkit flavour profile section. Shows top 5 active compound categories as horizontal intensity bars (color-coded green > 60%, yellow > 35%, purple default). Pills show descriptions on hover. |
| 8 | **🗓️ Seasonal Heatmap (Phase 3 shipped)** | Month-by-month heatmap grid: 12 columns (Jan–Dec) × ~150 ingredients grouped by category (Produce, Protein, Spices, Dairy, Grains). Color intensity = peak availability. Toggle between season view and heatmap view. |

#### Tier 3 — Infrastructure (2 items, ~2 hrs)

| # | Feature | Detail |
|---|---------|--------|
| 9 | **📴 Service Worker + Offline Caching** | `sw.js` (60 lines, 1.7 KB) caches `index.html` + `epicure_shared.json` on install, lazy-caches model JSONs on first fetch via stale-while-revalidate. Registers silently in `init()`. |
| 10 | **⚡ Map Viewport-Frustum Culling** | Point rendering loop skips points outside `[-10, W+10]` × `[-10, H+10]` — when zoomed in, only visible points are drawn instead of all 1,790. |

#### Gap Audit Fix
| Issue | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| `.consensus-badge` CSS class referenced but undefined | Added full styling rules |
| `#mapSearch` missing `aria-label` | Added `aria-label="Find ingredient on map"` |
| `#snapFileInput` missing `aria-label` | Added `aria-label="Upload food photo"` |
| Deep-link hash overwritten by `setupSearch()` → `selectIngredient('miso')` before hash was read | Captured initial hash into `deepLinkIngredient` before any setup runs |

#### Testing
- **57/57 Playwright end-to-end tests pass** across all 18 tabs, new features, responsive layouts, accessibility, deep-links, service worker, onboarding tour, gesture hints, and Chef's Toolkit
- All tests run headless against a static HTTP server with no dependencies beyond Playwright
- 0 console errors on load

---

## Session 10 — Feedback-Driven Polish Sprint

**Focus:** Responding to feedback on UX gaps, offline experience, exports, multilingual support, and semantic search.

### What Was Done

#### Tier 1 — Quick Wins
| # | Feature | Detail |
|---|---------|--------|
| 1 | **🗄️ Spoonacular Call Tracking + 429 Handling** | Daily 150-call limit tracked in localStorage with date-stamp reset. Live "X/150 calls left" display in Spoonacular tab. 429 and 402 HTTP responses produce user-facing messages including current usage. |
| 2 | **📡 Offline Banner** | Sticky amber bar at top of page: "📡 No internet connection — some features may be unavailable". Event-driven via `online`/`offline` listeners, also checked on `init()`. |
| 3 | **🔍 Search Alias System** | ~50 culinary name variants mapped (coriander→cilantro, aubergine→eggplant, prawn→shrimp, scallion→green_onion, etc.). Alias matches boosted to top of search results with "→ alias" visual indicator in dropdown. |
| 4 | **🔬 Density Heatmap Overlay** | New Map overlay option. 60×40 grid kernel density estimation with inverse-distance weighting. 5-color gradient (deep blue→cyan→lime→yellow→orange). Reveals ingredient clustering hotspots. Legend shows "Sparse"→"Dense". |
| 5 | **📴 Offline-Aware APIs** | `spoonFetch()` checks `navigator.onLine` before making API calls. `classifySnapImage()` shows retry button when offline. Network errors enhanced with clear "📡 Network error" messages. |

#### Tier 2 — Professional Exports
| # | Feature | Detail |
|---|---------|--------|
| 6 | **📥 CSV Neighbour Export** | "Download Neighbours CSV" button in Chef's Toolkit. Exports top neighbours across all loaded models + flavour profile as CSV with descriptive filename. Shows "✅ Downloaded" feedback momentarily. |
| 7 | **📸 Map PNG Export** | "PNG" button in Map legend area. Captures canvas directly via `canvas.toDataURL('image/png')`. Filename includes model + projection method. |
| 8 | **🔗 Share Link** | "Copy Share Link" button in Chef's Toolkit. Builds current deep-link URL (tab+model+ingredient+overlay) and copies to clipboard. |

#### Tier 3 — i18n & Semantic Search
| # | Feature | Detail |
|---|---------|--------|
| 9 | **🌐 5-Language i18n** | `UI_STRINGS` with 12 translated keys in EN, ES, FR, 中文, 日本語. `tr()` helper and `setLanguage()`. Language picker dropdown in header. Persisted in localStorage. Dynamic UI updates. |
| 10 | **🎯 Search Intent Detection** | 15 cuisine, 10 diet, and 3 nutrition keywords. `detectSearchIntent()` scans query text. Clickable pill chips below search: cuisine → SLERP tab, diet → GLP-1 filter / Spoonacular diet, nutrition → Map overlay. |

#### Tier 4 — Analytics
| # | Feature | Detail |
|---|---------|--------|
| 11 | **📊 Usage Tracking** | Lightweight localStorage-based analytics. `trackEvent()` with 500-event cap and aggregated counts. Tracks tab visits, ingredient selections, model switches. Privacy-preserving — no external calls. Viewable via 📊 footer link. |

#### Gap Audit Fixes
| Issue | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| No Spoonacular call tracking or quota feedback | Added `SPOON_DAILY_LIMIT`, `spoonGetCallsToday()`, `spoonTrackCall()` with date-stamped localStorage |

#### Testing
- **57/57 Playwright end-to-end tests pass** — all existing tests continue to pass after 598-line addition
- 0 console errors on load
- New features verified: alias search, intent chips, density heatmap, all exports (JS passes syntax validation)

## Session 12 — Map Performance, KDE Legend, Mobile UX

**Focus:** Map canvas rendering optimization, spatial index for click/hover, KDE scatter accumulation, interactive density legend, mobile chef sidebar, +4 E2E tests.

### What Was Done

| Phase | Feature | Detail |
|-------|---------|--------|
| **1** 🗺️ | **Batch point rendering** | Color-grouped points: single beginPath + one fill() per color group instead of 1790 individual arc/fill calls |
| **1** 🗺️ | **Spatial grid index** | 30×30 cell grid built after screenPts → click/hover checks 9 cells instead of 1790 points. Hover handler moved to setupMapInteractions (bound once, not re-created every frame) |
| **1** 🗺️ | **KDE scatter optimization** | Point-to-cell KDE accumulation: O(n × r²) instead of O(cells × n). Each point scatters to nearby grid cells, ~90× fewer distance checks |
| **2** 🌡️ | **Interactive KDE legend** | `nutrientBar` converted from CSS gradient to rendered canvas with exact 5-color density gradient + threshold marker line. Density info toggle explains colors. Clicking empty map area in density mode shows local density popup (auto-hides after 3s) |
| **3** 📱 | **Mobile chef sidebar** | New `@media (max-width: 420px)` breakpoint: padding 12px (from 20px), font-size 0.75rem, tighter tags/sub-items. Chef-toggle button compacted. No horizontal overflow |
| **4** ✅ | **4 new E2E tests** | Canvas content verification (sparse random sampling), KDE legend gradient rendering, density click info popup, chef sidebar mobile responsive at 420px |

## Session 13 — TheMealDB + TheCocktailDB + 200-Cuisine Map Labels

**Focus:** Adding free recipe providers (TheMealDB, TheCocktailDB) as Spoonacular fallbacks, enriching map cuisine labels with TheMealDB's 200+ area taxonomy.

### What Was Done

| Phase | Feature | Detail |
|-------|---------|--------|
| **1** 🌿 | **TheMealDB recipe provider** | `mealDBSearchRecipes()` searches by ingredient via `filter.php?i=...`. `mealDBGetRecipeInfo()` fetches full recipe via `lookup.php?i=...`. Shows thumbnails, ingredient list with measures, step-by-step instructions, YouTube links, source attribution. No API key needed (test key `1`) |
| **2** 🔄 | **Spoonacular → TheMealDB fallback** | `renderSpoonacular()` shows "🌿 Use TheMealDB (Free)" button when no Spoonacular key. `useMealDBFallback()` wires recipe search button to TheMealDB, hides wine/nutrition sections with "needs API key" messages, adds attribution bar. `spoonSearchRecipes()` auto-degrades via `if (!SPOON_KEY) { mealDBSearchRecipes(...); return; }`. Preference persisted in localStorage |
| **3** 🗺️ | **200-cuisine map labels** | `MEALDB_AREAS` (31 curated areas) + `MEALDB_AREA_CUISINE` (area → direction mapping). Map cuisine labels now show TheMealDB sub-areas beneath the main label when zoom ≥ 0.8× (e.g. "Mediterranean" with "Italian · Greek · Turkish" below it) |
| **4** 🍸 | **TheCocktailDB integration** | `cocktailDBFetch()` + `searchCocktailDB()` + `showCocktailDBDetail()`. Cocktail tab's `runCocktail()` now calls `searchCocktailDB(spirit)` at end, showing real cocktail recipes with ingredients, instructions, glass type, YouTube links alongside embedding-based suggestions |
| **5** ✅ | **2 new E2E tests** | Spoonacular tab shows TheMealDB fallback button, useMealDBFallback shows recipe search input. **72/72 tests pass** |

| **🐛 Dead GLP-1 intent chip path** | 🔴 HIGH | `applyIntent('diet', 'glp1')` referenced non-existent `glp1Filter` element and undefined `updateChefToolkit()` — now correctly calls `toggleGlpFilter()` |
| **🐛 roundRect polyfill** | 🔴 HIGH | `ctx.roundRect()` threw TypeError on older browsers — added inline polyfill |
| **🐛 Stale file size in docs** | 🟡 MEDIUM | GUIDE.md and README.md said 259 KB — actual is 422 KB |
| **🐛 Unused variables removed** | 🟡 MEDIUM | `pcaAnimationId`, `DENSITY_INFO_VISIBLE`, `DENSITY_INFO_POPUP` cleaned up |
| **🐛 Missing CSS class** | 🟡 MEDIUM | `.spoon-recipe-grid` CSS class added |
| **🐛 Hardcoded Spoonacular limit** | 🟡 MEDIUM | `SPOON_DAILY_LIMIT` configurable via localStorage + UI field |
| **🐛 Test file fixes** | 🟡 MEDIUM | "All 18 Tab Panels" → 19 with builddish; removed 4 redundant tests (72→68) |
| **🐛 Redundant test removed** | 🟢 LOW | Build-Dish panel existence test removed (covered by 19-tab loop) |

### Session 14b — im2recipe Week 1: Nutritional Integration

| Phase | Feature | Detail |
|-------|---------|--------|
| **1** 🔬 | **`build_nutrition.py`** | USDA-derived nutrition DB for 500+ ingredients, food-group heuristics for all 1,790 Epicure ingredients, FSA traffic lights. Outputs im2recipe-Pytorch format |
| **2** 📦 | **`data/epicure_nutrition.json`** | 789 KB — all 1,790 ingredients with `nutr_values_per100g`, `fsa_lights_per100g`, `nutr_per_100g_extended`. 409 exact USDA matches, 1,381 food-group estimated |
| **3** 🗺️ | **Vocabulary bridge** | `data/nutrition_vocab.json` (114 KB) — 3,531 entries mapping im2recipe names ↔ Epicure canonical names |
| **4** 🧠 | **FSA Health Direction** | `computeHealthDirection()` — computes embedding centroid of healthy (3+ green) vs indulgent (2+ red) ingredients, creates direction vector. `💚 FSA Health` in SLERP dropdown under `💪 Health` |
| **5** 🥗 | **Recipe Nutrition tab** | 4th Recipe Explorer subtab (`🥗 Nutrition`). Shows per-ingredient FSA traffic lights when no 35K data loaded; shows per-recipe FSA scores when data is present |
| **6** 📥 | **35K per-recipe importer** | `build_nutrition.py --import-im2recipe` — processes the im2recipe 35K JSON into `data/recipe_nutrition.json` |
| **7** 🔗 | **Ingredient→Recipe index** | `det_ingrs.json` (1M+ Recipe1M detections) processed into `data/recipe_detections_slim.json` (2.1 MB) — 622 ingredients linked to nutrition recipes |
| **8** 💾 | **Offline caching** | `sw.js` caches `epicure_nutrition.json`, `recipe_nutrition.json`, `recipe_detections_slim.json` |

### What was downloaded (im2recipe data access)

| File | Size | App derivative |
|------|------|----------------|

## Session 15 — Safety, Performance, a11y & Seasonal Data Extraction

**Focus:** Responding to a deep codebase audit: fix runtime safety gaps, add search debounce, fix branding/a11y gaps, extract seasonal data from hardcoded JS into data-driven format.

### What Was Done

#### Phase 1 — Runtime Safety
| Fix | Detail |
|-----|--------|
| **🔄 Retry on load failure** | `init()` catch now shows ❌ message + "🔄 Retry" button that re-invokes `init()` |
| **🔄 Model-load error display** | `setupModelTabs()` shows user-visible error in active panel with refresh button on model load failure |
| **🧮 NaN/Infinity guard** | `dotProduct()` now skips non-finite products, returns 0 on degenerate inputs; vector decode replaces NaN/Infinity vectors with zeros |
| **🛡️ Spoonacular null guard** | `spoonGetRecipeInfo()` checks info response is a valid object before accessing nested properties |

#### Phase 2 — Search Debounce
| Fix | Detail |
|-----|--------|
| **⏱️ 150ms debounce** | Smart search `input` handler wrapped in `clearTimeout`/`setTimeout` pattern — no longer fires on every keystroke |
| **👂 Listener audit** | Confirmed `setupMapInteractions()` one-time guard prevents accumulator leak on model/tab switch |

#### Phase 3 — Branding & a11y
| Fix | Detail |
|-----|--------|
| **🎨 theme-color sync** | `toggleTheme()` now updates `<meta name="theme-color">` — `#0f0f13` (dark) ↔ `#f5f5fa` (light) |
| **📱 PWA icons** | Generated 192×192 and 512×512 PNG icons (purple plate/fork design); added to manifest + `apple-touch-icon` + SW cache preload |
| **♿ Canvas aria-label** | `#pcaCanvas` now has descriptive `aria-label="Map of ingredient embeddings — navigation, cuisine regions, and density overlay"` |

#### Phase 4 — Data-Driven Seasonal
| Fix | Detail |
|-----|--------|
| **📦 Seasonal extraction** | 149 seasonal entries moved from `const SEASONAL_DATA` in `index.html` into `epicure_shared.json["seasonal"]` |
| **🔄 Runtime override** | `loadSharedData()` sets `SEASONAL_DATA = json.seasonal` if available; inline constant preserved as fallback |
| **📏 `const` → `var`** | `SEASONAL_DATA` changed from `const` to `var` to allow reassignment |

### Metrics Update

| Metric | Session 14 | Session 15 |

| Seasonal data | Hardcoded JS constant | ✅ Data-driven from `epicure_shared.json` |
| Search debounce | ❌ per-keystroke | ✅ 150ms trailing-edge |
| theme-color sync | ❌ hardcoded | ✅ dark/light toggle updates meta |
| Canvas aria-label | ❌ missing | ✅ descriptive label added |
